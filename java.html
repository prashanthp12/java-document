<!-- JAVA SCRIPT -->

<!--ECMA SCRIPT ==> it is strandard for javascript or it's set of rules for javascript , based upon ecma script standsrds browser companies update their own browsers -->

<!-- ECMA ==> european computers manufacturer association -->

<!--  ecma script strating version => es262 -->

<!-- is javascript is client side or server side ? ==> both server and client side, server side we're using node.js -->

<!-- libraries built upon javascript ? ==> angular.js, react.js, vue.js, ember.js, express.js, node.js, next.js  -->

<!-- what is the diefference between library and frame work ? ==> fremework is the collection of libraries, library can able to solve one particular issue only -->

<!--  javscript features ==> open source ==> cross-platform, ==> synchronous  ==>  single threaded  -->

<!-- is javascrit is compiler or interpeter ? interpeter  -->

<!-- compiler ==> it will execute code at a time -->

<!-- interpeter ==> it will execute the code line by line -->

<!-- es6 features ? 

              ==> let , const keywords
                           
              ==> template literals denoted by (``)

              ==> spread and rest operator denoted by (...)

              ==> destructuring of array and object

              ==> arrow functions  denoted by (()=>)

              ==> HOF [higher order functions ==> map, reduce, filter, find]

              ==> promises

              ==> prototypes

<!-- statically typed ==> we need to specify data type of a variable eg : char name=" some"  eg : c, java -->

<!-- dynamically typed ==> we don't need to specify data type of a variable eg : var name ="some" eg : javaScript, python -->

<!--  is javscript statically typed or dynamically typed ? javascript is dynamically typed language -->

<!-- what is constructor ? which is used to intilize an object-->

<!-- what are the ways to declare a variable in javaScript ? 

we can declare variable in three ways

==> var, let, const 
-->

<!-- what is scope ? life time visibility or area of accesibility of an variable  -->

<!-- how many number of scopes are there in javascript  ? global scope & functional scope  but when ever we are using let or const key word it'll create "block scope" to the javascript-->

<!-- hoisting ==> it's javascript interpreter behaviour, it will take all the declarations to the top  -->

<!-- what are the things are hoisted in JavaScript ?  var , function declarations are hoisted in javascript -->

<!-- what's the difference between var ,let and const key words ?

=============================var============================================

by using var , we can re-declare a variable   ==> var a =10; var a =100;

we can re-assign the value   var b =100; b = 1000;

we can able to write multiple lines for initialization and assigning   ==> var c; c= 10000;

var is hoisted allocated memory in global scope

we can able to access var keyword variable before initialization ==> console.log(d); var d =100000;

=============================let============================================

by using let , we can't able to  re-declare a variable 

we can re-assign the value   let b =100; b = 1000;

we can able to write multiple lines for initialization and assigning   ==> let c; c= 10000;

let is hoisted but it will allocate memory in different space [script]

we can't able to access let keyword variable before initialization 


=============================const============================================

by using const , we can't able to  re-declare a variable 

we can't able  re-assign the value

we can't able to write multiple lines for initialization and assigning

const is hoisted but it will allocate memory in different space [script]

we can't able to access const keyword variable before initialization 

-->

<!-- temporial dead-zone ?
 
when ever we declaring variables with let or const key words and try to accees before initialization ,
   we can't able to access before initialization ,
   after initialization we can able to access the value ,
   these time period is called as temporial dead zone

-->

<!-- how you can access global scope ? ==>  by using window or this -->

<!-- DOM ? Document object modal -->

<!-- array ? ==> collection of multiple values  ==> let arr = [1,2,"hello", true]  -->

<!-- object ? ==> collection of key, value pairs ==> let obj ={a:100, b:200} -->

<!--  data types in javascript ? 
javascript doen't have any data types but values have data types

==> primitive data type
 
          ==> string, number, boolean, null, undefined

==> non-primitive data type

          ==> array, object, regular expressions [regex]
-->

<!-- how you check type of any value in javascript ?

by using typeof() , we cab able to identify the type of the values

==> what is the type of null
       typeof(null); // object
       typeof(undefined); // undefined
       typeof(NaN); // number
       typeof([]); // object
-->

<!--  what is block ? gropup of statements -->

<!--  what is function ? logical group of one or more expressions  -->

<!-- what are the possible ways we can able to create a function in javascript ?

  ==> function declaration, function expression , arrow function

==> function declaration syntax : 

                               function functionName(a, b){  // declaration
                                                     return a + b // returing the value
                                                           }
                               functionName(a, b) // invokation it will show the returned value



==> function expression syntax :

                         let functionName = function(a,b){
                                                     return a + b
                                                     }
                                              functionName()

==> arrow function syntax :

                            let functionName=(a, b)=> a + b
                            functionName()


-->

<!-- difference between function declaration, function expression and arrow function ? IPQ

==> function delarations are hoisted and expression and arrow functions are not hoisted

==> arrow function concise the function syntax, we don't need to write a function keyword ,

     if it's single line of code we don't need to write return also

==> arrow function don't have own this data, it will take the parent this data  [imp]

-->

<!-- what is call stack ? 
 there's is only one call stack in the browser engine, it will execute the code [LIFO ==> last in first out]
   -->

<!-- what is event loop ? 
 it will acts a mediator in between callStack and callback queue,
  it will keep on checking is callStack is clear or not and if callStack is clear it will give highest priority to the micro tasks,
   if any micro tasks are vailable in callBack queue ,
    event loop push the tasks in the call stack if call stacl is empty,
     if there's no micro tasks then it will go to macro tasks  -->

<!-- what is call back ?
         callback is function it will execute after the actual function execution
     -->

<!-- first class function ? 
      we can able to assaign a function to the variable ,
       we can pass function as and argument in javascript
     -->


     <!-- what is closure ?
        ==> function bundle together with it's lexical environment
        ==> inner function can able to access parent function local variables by itself

        syntax : 

                   function functionName(){  // parent function
                                           let a =1000; // parent function local variables
                                                    function (){  // children function
                                                                console.log(a)  // getting value from parent
                                                                }() // children invokation

                                           }functionName() // parent invokation
     
     -->

<!-- callback-hell issue ? -->

<!-- how you prevent global variable issue ? -->

<!--  array methods ? 

   ==> in javaScript array is 0 based index

   ==> if you want to access array elemnets  ==> arr[index]
      
      ==> mutator methods 

                        push      ==> arrName.push     // (element want to add end of the array),

                        pop       ==> arrName.pop()    // it will removes item from end of the array,

                        shift     ==> arrName.shift()  // it will removes item from starting of the array,

                        unshift   ==> arrName.unshift(elemnet want to add starting of the array),

                        slice     ==> arrname.slice(starting index, end index), 

                        splice    ==> arrname.splice(start index, count of delete , items to add) ,

                        fill      ==> arr.fill(fill with  , start index, end index),  

                        delete    ==> delete arrname[index],

                        split     ==> arr.split(""),

                        reverse   ==> arr.revrse(),

                        join      ==> arr.join(""),

                        replace   ==> arr.replace( replaced val, new val,),

                        concat    ==> let arr =[1,2,3]; let arr1=[4,5,6]; let arr2 = arr.concat(arr1);

                        sort      ==> arr.sort() 

                        trim      ==> it will remove spaces from starting and ending of the string ==> str.trim()

      ==> iterator methods

                        ==> map, reduce, filter, find
